We will use the same methods to simulate a solution to the geometric growth model. However, since there are 7 different scenarios for which we will want to simulate a solution trajectory, copying and pasting the same code over and over, just changing a couple parameters isn't the best idea. For example, if you realize that you have an error in the code, or that there is a better way to do something, you will have to go back and change each of the copies of the code. It is better practice to instead define a function that takes arguments for the parameters that change, and outputs what you want.\n",
